General Case Studies data collection and production of aggregated statistics
Cases Studies is a template application which covers various cases which are caused internationally. It collects data form various districts and send them to a central point in order statistics to be produced. The subsystem of sending data is not available, but it can be easily accomplished through an appropriate web service.  We have regions internationally. A case-study takes place in multiple regions called â€œcase regions. Each case regions contains multiple municipalities and each municipality contains one or more stations in which the data are collected and are registered. After data registration is completed, the send process can take place in order the registered data to be transmitted to a central point for further manipulation and production of aggregated results.
